                                            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                With the world remerging from the pandemic that had shuttered doors and kept people in isolation, high stress levels and increased anxiety took a toll on many indidivuals, especially impacting the older generation. These people are turning to many different methods to cope with their newfound stress - coloring being one of them. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>So how can coloring help?</p>
                                            <p>
                                                In a 2006 study, researchers at Thomas Jefferson University found that art therapy for women can significantly decrease symptoms of phsyical and emotional stress. Furthermore, researchers have also found that coloring complex geometric designs, such as mandalas can lead to a reduction in anxiety levels and suggests colouring may induce a meditative state.</p>
                                            <p>How can we best design a mobile experience that sparks joy and reduces stress for older individuals?</p>

                                            <h3>Team</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                During this design process, I worked cross-functionally with several teams ranging from business, creative and development. 

                                                On the business side, I collaborated with the product manager and to align UX goals with that of the brand. I communicated my ideas and designs to the business analysts, who documented and wrote requirements. 

                                                In the design phase, I worked with two UI Designers, as well the Creative Director to ensure that the design fit our target audience and brand. We worked iteratively and I provided several low-fidelity wires and prototypes.

                                                During the research phase, I was directly responsible for performing a competitive audit on three similar coloring platforms. Through this audit, I  captured details about the UX, navigation and features. This analysis was converted into a presentation that was then presented by the product manager to department leaders. From here, the UX team worked closely with the business team to determine the functional requirements.

                                <p>With our objective to bring joy and relieve stress of our current userbase, we introduced Jacquie Lawson Colouring. This app enables users to color their stress away. After completing a coloring page, they're able to further interact with this artwork by creating a puzzle out of it, or sharing it with their loved ones.</p>

                                        <li>There could have been more extensive user testing and feedback, during the gathering of requirements and creation of the prototype.</li>

                                                Initially, one survey was sent out during the research phase to gather interest, however more surveys could have been sent out after the launch to gather feedback.
