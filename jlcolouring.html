                            Jacquie Lawson, a subsidiary of American Greetings, started as a small British ecard business in 2002 that expanded to include
                            games, advent calendars and much more! Known for elegant artwork, high-quality animation and
                            music, Jacquie Lawson aspires to bring joy to their users, and with that - the colouring app
                            was launched! Adult coloring apps are known to reduce stress and anxiety, while subsequently bringing joy to users.

                        <p>
                            Jacquie Lawson Colouring was created to reduce stress, prompt creativity and encourage interaction with

                        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                        <p>Jacquie Lawson users have expressed their desires to interact with the artwork over the years. 
                            While they love the current ecards - both sending and receiving, they want another way to 
                            <strong>connect with the brand</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Simultaneously, the world was reemerging from the pandemic that shuttered doors. This greatly affected 
                            older individuals, including much of Jacquie Lawson's userbase, and many reported increased levels of 
                            anxiety and high stress.  
                        </p>
                        <p>So how can Jacquie Lawson help and give back to the community?</p>
                        <p>
                            In a 2006 study, researchers at Thomas Jefferson University found that art therapy for women
                            can significantly decrease symptoms of physical and emotional stress. Furthermore,
                            researchers have also found that coloring complex geometric designs, such as mandalas can
                            lead to a reduction in anxiety levels and suggests coloring may induce a meditative state.
                        </p>
                        <p>We wanted to create a mobile experience that allows users to connect with Jacquie Lawson while reducing stress.</p>

                        <h3>Team</h3>
                        <p>
                            During this design process, I worked cross-functionally with several teams ranging from
                            business, creative and development.

                            On the business side, I collaborated with the product manager to align UX goals with
                            that of the brand. I communicated my ideas and designs to the business analysts, who
                            documented and wrote requirements.

                            In the design phase, I worked with two Visual Designers, as well the Creative Director to ensure
                            that the design fit our target audience and brand. We worked iteratively and I provided
                            several low-fidelity wireframes and prototypes.

                        <p>
                            During the research phase, I was directly responsible for performing a competitive audit on
                            three similar coloring platforms. Through this audit, I captured details about the UX,
                            navigation and features.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Coloring can be more complex than it seems. We needed a way for users to be able to express
                            their creativity through colors and textures, as well as make the app accessible for older
                            users with sight or limited mobility. Several complex challenges were identified during the competitive audit and research
                            sessions. Iterating and validating functional requirements was essential, especially with
                            our development time constraints.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During this period, it was the utmost importance for the UX team to work closely with the
                            business and development teams to determine feasibility and ideate solutions to our
                            challenges.

                        This gave us a baseline for user testing.

                    <h3 class="m-3">Solution</h3>
                    <p>With our objective to bring joy and relieve stress of our current userbase, we introduced Jacquie
                        Lawson Colouring. This app enables users to color their stress away. After completing a coloring
                        page, they're able to further interact with this artwork by creating a puzzle out of it, or
                        sharing it with their loved ones.</p>

                    <h5>How it works</h5>
                    <br />
                    <div class="center">
                        <div>
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="images/jlcolouring/coloring.png" alt="Coloring Screens" />
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Coloring made simple:</strong>
                        Designing for mobile means making use of smaller spaces. We made it easy for users to color
                        small spaces by implementing features such as: pinch & zoom, recent used colors and swipe to
                        color.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since our user base consists of mostly of older women, we wanted the coloring area to occupy the majority of 
                        the screen and focus. However, we still needed to make room for key features such as color palettes 
                        and different coloring tools. 
                    </p>
                    <p> The color palette was placed on the left side for easy access to a wide variety of color themes. Since 
                        there's no limitations to the shades of colors, the decision to add a recently used color feature at the 
                        bottom serves as personalized color palette. Users can bounce back and forth between colors and this feature
                        will save the latest five. We felt that this feature was extremely important to users as they switch between
                        color palettes and color gradients. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The interaction between the different tools was also a matter of debate. The objective was to find an easy way 
                        for users to access and browse different tools to color without occupying too much space on the screen. The 
                        solution ended up being a slide out drawer with selected tools. To ensure that the paint tube was not overlooked 
                        as a way to open the tools, a tutorial was implemented on users' first interaction with the coloring screen.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Interact with artwork:</strong>
                        In previous Jacquie Lawson games and advent calendars, users enjoyed a variety of puzzles. However, their puzzle choices
                        were often limited, and feedback from our previous games suggest that users enjoyment would increase with
                        more puzzle variety. Our solution was to integrate this feature in the coloring app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of the app was not to compete with other coloring competitors, but serve as a complement to
                        the Jacquie Lawson brand. Since the user base already enjoys games and puzzles, we decided to take their
                        artwork to the next level and allow them to interact with it. Mimicking our other games, we've added 
                        several difficulty levels where users can challenge themselves and enjoy their creations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A large part of Jacquie Lawson's brand is sharing. Whether ecards, games or artwork, users often enjoy
                        sharing with their loved ones. With this in mind, we allowed users to share their artwork in two places: 
                        once they finish coloring and on their My Work page. This allows users to share at any time through text, 
                        email, and social media.

                    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                    <p>As the coloring app continues to serve users, the team is constantly learning and growing with the
                        addition of user feedback. However, I recognize that there could have been more extensive user
                        testing and feedback, during the gathering of requirements and creation of the prototype.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Initially, one survey was sent out during the research phase to gather interest, however
                            more surveys could have been sent out after the launch to gather feedback.

                        <li>
                            A/B Testing could have been used to determine the pricing and subscription.

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Jacquie Lawson Colouring app launched on the Apple App Store and Google Play in October of
                        2021. The feedback we received from users were positive, with many stating that the designs are
                        beautifully executed and align with the brand. The team is still actively gathering user
                        feedback and iterating to create the best possible experience for our users.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Next Steps</h5>
                    <p>
                        The app has received high praise from users, and the development team plans to add additional
                        features that would expand the userbase. Potential features include:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Gallery</li>
                        <ul>
                            This option would allow users to not only share their artwork with friends, but also foster
                            a community within the app. Users can use this feature to get inspired and engage with
                            others' artwork through comments.
                        </ul>
                        <li>Art Upload
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            Users can feel even more connected by uploading their own coloring sheets. From personal
                            photos to images found online, this option would expand the selection of a user's coloring
                            and puzzle options.
                        </ul>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <div class="center">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="images/jlcolouring/palette-icon.png" alt="Icon" />
                    </div>
                    <p class="center">Thank you for exploring Jacquie Lawson Colouring! Hopeful you enjoyed this case
                        study. </p>
