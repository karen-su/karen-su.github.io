                    <p>While vacations are meant to be relaxing, a company-wide golfing vacation is bound to stir up
                        some problems along the way,
                        let alone a joint-company vacation. From accomodation information to tournament logistics, both
                        the organizer of this golf vacation and the golfers themselves often struggle to keep track of
                        everything.

                        PocketGolf is a custom mobile app used to coordinate golfing vacations.

                            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                            <p>To build morale and cultivate company culture, every year Innovation Software Solutions
                                collaborates with another local startup
                                and attend a golfing vacation. Typically, a total of 20 individuals, 10 from each
                                company will attend and network across
                                four days. While golf and a vacation, or "golfcation" as they say, sound great, several
                                things can go amiss.
                            </p>
                            <p>Logistics for a typical vacation can be a nightmare, let alone organizing for 20
                                participants. In addition, with several emails being
                                passed around, it's common for participants to miss important information. Lastly,
                                keeping track of golf scores also poses a problem
                                amongst participatns. </p>
                            <p>How can we create a software solution to allow this annual "golfcation" to go smoothly?

                            <p>During research phase, our team analyzed similar platforms, such as ESPN, to gain insight
                                on UX of sporting apps. In addition, we researched tools related to golf, and spoke with
                                the client about their use cases.Through this process, we identified two distinct
                                personas, which represent different
                                needs. Data for these two personas were gathered by interactions with potential users.

                            <p>After gathering research and insights from the client and potential users, my team
                                identified the following pain points:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    There is a behavioral gap in tournament scoring, and golfers often will either
                                    forget to document their scores or document their scores incorrectly, leading to
                                    confusion and disputes between players.
                                </li>
                                <li>There is no centralized place to store important information, and multiple emails
                                    are passed around in the weeks leading up to the event. This causes a lack of
                                    organization for participants.
                                </li>
                                <li>Even though the phone numbers of each participant is shared with the rest of the
                                    group, there are issues finding and contacting others.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5>User Flow</h5>
                            <p>After analyzing the main use case of storing tournament information and scoring, I
                                developed a user flow that further demonstrates the main task of the application.
                            </p>

                            <p>My solution to this problem is a mobile app, Pocket Golf, your personal golf assistant.
                                This app enables golfers to enjoy their golf vacations without the disorganization or
                                the worry. The app is designed to have a sleek and professional look to conveniently
                                enhance golfersâ€™ vacation. </p>

                            <p>The original landing page lacked a central focal point for the user. With the split
                                screen view, the user is presented with double the information, which may be
                                overwhelming. This caused the user to spend more time on the page, searching for
                                information.</p>
                            <p>The goal was to simplify the landing page, so the user can navigate to the desired
                                information without having to spend extra time searching.After iterating with the
                                stakeholders, these three Agency Lessons became the core of this
                                page. The three panels indicates that each is a clickable item, and the icons give the
                                users an idea about what each section contains.</p>
                            <p>The lack of scrolling on this page ensures that all information is either presented
                                immediately on the page, or through accessible links.</p>

                            <p>The original page featured a very long list of case studies, without a search component.
                                While this allowed detailed text to describe each study, users spent extra minutes
                                scrolling to find their desired case study.</p>
                            <p>Since government computers tend to have smaller screens, the main concern here was
                                finding
                                a way to visually present the information and eliminate excess scrolling.
                                The black overlay expands to the full width of the picture when hovered over, and thus
                                retains
                                the ability to display detailed text, without taking excessive vertical space. </p>

                            <p>
                                Throughout the process of redesigning this area of the website, it was tempting to
                                create
                                custom, modern layouts with new sleek colors. The ultimate challenge was creating a
                                unified
                                theme amongst the hodgepodge of pages.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I found that reusing existing patterns and limiting colors not only reduced risk of
                                sensory
                                overload for the users, but also easier on the developerâ€™s end (in this case, me) to
                                build.
                                That being said, there is still a lot to be improved on SFTool.

                            <p>SFTool still has several other pages that need to be redesigned to fit this new, modern
                                look.
                                If given the opportunity, Iâ€™d like to create a unified style-guide that would inform
                                design
                                decisions to implement a unified, consistent style. </p>
