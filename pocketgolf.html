                    <p>While vacations are meant to be relaxing, a company-wide golfing vacation is bound to stir up
                        some problems along the way,
                        let alone a joint-company vacation. From accomodation information to tournament logistics, both
                        the organizer of this golf vacation and the golfers themselves often struggle to keep track of
                        everything.

                        PocketGolf is a custom mobile app used to coordinate golfing vacations.

                            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                            <p>To build morale and cultivate company culture, every year Innovation Software Solutions
                                collaborates with another local startup
                                and attend a golfing vacation. Typically, a total of 20 individuals, 10 from each
                                company will attend and network across
                                four days. While golf and a vacation, or "golfcation" as they say, sound great, several
                                things can go amiss.
                            </p>
                            <p>Logistics for a typical vacation can be a nightmare, let alone organizing for 20
                                participants. In addition, with several emails being
                                passed around, it's common for participants to miss important information. Lastly,
                                keeping track of golf scores also poses a problem
                                amongst participatns. </p>
                            <p>How can we create a software solution to allow this annual "golfcation" to go smoothly?

                            <h4>Research</h4>
                            <p>During research phase, our team analyzed similar platforms, such as ESPN, to gain insight
                                on UX of sporting apps. In addition, we researched tools related to golf, and spoke with
                                the client about their use cases.Through this process, we identified two distinct
                                personas, which represent different
                                needs. Data for these two personas were gathered by interactions with potential users.

                            <p>After gathering research and insights from the client and potential users, my team
                                identified the following pain points:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    There is a behavioral gap in tournament scoring, and golfers often will either
                                    forget to document their scores or document their scores incorrectly, leading to
                                    confusion and disputes between players.
                                </li>
                                <li>There is no centralized place to store important information, and multiple emails
                                    are passed around in the weeks leading up to the event. This causes a lack of
                                    organization for participants.
                                </li>
                                <li>Even though the phone numbers of each participant is shared with the rest of the
                                    group, there are issues finding and contacting others.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5>User Flow</h5>
                            <p>After analyzing the main use case of storing tournament information and scoring, I
                                developed a user flow that further demonstrates the main task of the application.
                            </p>
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="images/pocketgolf/User Flow.png" alt="User Flow" />
                            <h4 class="m-3">Solution</h4>
                            <p>My solution to this problem is a mobile app, PocketGolf, your personal golf assistant.
                                This app enables golfers to enjoy their golf vacations without the disorganization or
                                the worry. The app is designed to have a sleek and professional look to conveniently
                                enhance golfers’ vacation. </p>
                            <div class="center">
                                <img class="center img-fluid" src="images/pocketgolf/golf-icon.png" alt="Icon" />
                            </div>
                            <p><strong>Tournament:</strong> Gameplay is made easier with the useful course and hole
                                information,
                                and scoring is kept simple and familiar.</p>
                            <div class="center">
                                <img class="img-fluid screens" src="images/pocketgolf/tournament.png" alt="Icon" />
                            </div>
                            <p>PocketGolf clearly displays the user’s golfing information, such as date, time and
                                course location with the tap of an icon. The couse overview enables the user to view
                                each individual hole information to strategize their play, as well as view the
                                positioning of other teams. </p>
                            <div class="center">
                                <img class="img-fluid screens" src="images/pocketgolf/score.png" alt="Icon" />
                            </div>
                            <p>By selecting the hole on the Course Overview screen, the user is able to enter to enter
                                scores for the match. PocketGolf will prompt users to enter scores, thus preventing the
                                user from forgetting to document their scores.The Review screen allows all four players
                                to compare scores before submitting and fix
                                any scoring discrepancies. </p>
                            <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The data gathered was a small subset (15%) of the users. </li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        There could have been more extensive user testing, but contact with ISS and users
                                        was limited to two in-person meetings and several emails.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Creating a survey could have been a simple way to collect data amongst all users.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>The users interviews were trip organizers, which did not give us a clear prospective
                                    on all users.</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Soliciting user data would have been beneficial, especially since data existed on
                                            past attendees.</li>
                                        <li>Reaching out to stakeholders to ask for interview volunteers could have diversified
                                            our data set. </li>
                                    </ul>
                            </ol>
                            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                            <p>Due to time constraints, our team rushed into the design process. This, however, delayed
                                our timeline, and we should have taken more time to discuss user goals and prioritzation
                                with the members at ISS. More extensive user testing needed to be conducted in order
                                to validate the solution.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Developing a user flow was very helpful, but should have been done early in the process.
                                Our team’s happy path was split amongst multiple user flows, and we opted for more
                                features than one centralized one, which affected our end product.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even though we faced challenges, our team was selected as First Place as the
                                Stakeholder’s choice. Our team spent the most time with the Client, and they felt our
                                design was the most professional. Innovation Software Solutions took inspiration from our design, 
                                and used this to develop their application!

                            <p>Since government computers tend to have smaller screens, the main concern here was
                                finding
                                a way to visually present the information and eliminate excess scrolling.
                                The black overlay expands to the full width of the picture when hovered over, and thus
                                retains
                                the ability to display detailed text, without taking excessive vertical space. </p>

                            <p>
                                Throughout the process of redesigning this area of the website, it was tempting to
                                create
                                custom, modern layouts with new sleek colors. The ultimate challenge was creating a
                                unified
                                theme amongst the hodgepodge of pages.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I found that reusing existing patterns and limiting colors not only reduced risk of
                                sensory
                                overload for the users, but also easier on the developer’s end (in this case, me) to
                                build.
                                That being said, there is still a lot to be improved on SFTool.
                            </p>
                            <p>SFTool still has several other pages that need to be redesigned to fit this new, modern
                                look.
                                If given the opportunity, I’d like to create a unified style-guide that would inform
                                design
                                decisions to implement a unified, consistent style. </p>
