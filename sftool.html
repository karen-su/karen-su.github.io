							<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
							<p>While the Sustainability Facilities Tool has been operating for the past several
								years, the <strong>design has been slow to change.</strong>
								There had been issues concerning <strong>site organization</strong>, and
								stakeholders requested a more modern feel.
							</p>
							<p>How can we best promote sustainability within facilities purchasing and present the information in clear, concise manner?</p>

							<h4>Discovery</h4>
							<p>The stakeholders had a clear idea of the content they wanted. Since this was a public
								Federal Government website, it needed to be comply with <strong>accessibility
								needs</strong>. I
								conducted research on accessibility standards to better understand potential users.
								My target audience was mostly the stakeholders in question, so interviewing them and
								understanding their needs allowed me to gain further insight on their pain points.
							</p>
							<p>Through several iterations and stakeholder feedback, I found:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									The new section needed to match the look and feel of other upgraded pages.
								</li>
								<li>
									With busy schedules, users wanted <strong>information at a glance</strong>.
									Scrolling down the page was the least preferable option.
								</li>
								<li>
									Users were frequently on the go, so the site must be <strong>accessible from
										phone, tablet and laptop</strong>.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<h4 class="m-3">Challenges</h4>
							<p>Since the website was over 10 years old, it had undergone various phases of redesign by several different engineers and companies.
								This led to a lack of consistency across the website - it lacked a style guide, basic layouts and unified color choices. With limited
								resouces, I had my work cut out for me.
							</p>
							<h4 class="m-3">Mockups & Validation</h4>
							<p>A simple wireframe had been completed during the inital stakeholder meeting using PowerPoint. I expanded upon some key features to create a mid-level wireframe.
								I participated in a meeting with four stakeholders to present my research and findings. 
							</p>
							<h4 class="m-3">Implementation</h4>
							<p>After gathering all the information from the stakeholders and existing development
								team, I started by creating a high-fidelity mock up. A simple wireframe had already
								been completed during the inital stakeholder meeting. Most of the information was
								extracted from the existing website. Content for new
								pages was provided by the stakeholders.</p>
							<h5 class="m-t-3">Apply Landing Page</h5>
						</div>
						<div class="spacer-1"></div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6">
							<img class="img-fluid" src="images/sftool/Apply Before.png" alt="Karen Su" />
							<h5 class="center">Before</h5>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6">
							<img class="img-fluid" src="images/sftool/Apply After.png" alt="Karen Su" />
							<h5 class="center">After</h5>
						</div>
						<div class="spacer-1"></div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-12">
							<p>The original landing page lacked a central focal point for the user. With the split
								screen view, the user is presented with double the information, which may be
								overwhelming. This caused the user to spend more time on the page, searching for
								information.</p>
							<p>The goal was to simplify the landing page, so the user can navigate to the desired
								information without having to spend extra time searching.After iterating with the
								stakeholders, these three Agency Lessons became the core of this
								page. The three panels indicates that each is a clickable item, and the icons give the
								users an idea about what each section contains.</p>
							<p>The lack of scrolling on this page ensures that all information is either presented
								immediately on the page, or through accessible links.</p>
							<h5 class="m-t-3">Case Studies Page</h5>	
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6">
							<img class="img-fluid" src="images/sftool/Apply Before.png" alt="Karen Su" />
							<h5 class="center">Before</h5>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6">
							<img class="img-fluid" src="images/sftool/Apply After.png" alt="Karen Su" />
							<h5 class="center">After</h5>
						</div>
						<div class="spacer-1"></div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-12">
							<p>The original page featured a very long list of case studies, without a search component.
								While this allowed detailed text to describe each study, users spent extra minutes
								scrolling to find their desired case study.</p>
							<p>Since government computers tend to have smaller screens, the main concern here was
								finding
								a way to visually present the information and eliminate excess scrolling.
								The black overlay expands to the full width of the picture when hovered over, and thus
								retains
								the ability to display detailed text, without taking excessive vertical space. </p>

						<h4 class="m-3">Lessons Learned</h4>
						<p>
							Throughout the process of redesigning this area of the website, it was tempting to create
							custom, modern layouts with new sleek colors. The ultimate challenge was creating a unified
							theme amongst the hodgepodge of pages.
						</p>
						<p>
							I found that reusing existing patterns and limiting colors not only reduced risk of sensory
							overload for the users, but also easier on the developer’s end (in this case, me) to build.
							That being said, there is still a lot to be improved on SFTool.
						</p>
						<p>SFTool still has several other pages that need to be redesigned to fit this new, modern look.
							If given the opportunity, I’d like to create a unified style-guide that would inform design
							decisions to implement a unified, consistent style. </p>
