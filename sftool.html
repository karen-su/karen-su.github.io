							The General Services Administration (GSA) aids the Federal Government in making
							sustainable decisions regarding the procurement of high-performance, healthy
							buildings. With each high-performance building, this benefits taxpayers and
							employees alike by conserving resources, better air quality and lowered utility costs.
						</p>
						<p>
							SFTool, a website, was created to inspire those to learn about sustainability and take
							action.

					<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
					<p>While the Sustainability Facilities Tool has been operating for the past several years, the
						<strong>design has been slow to change.
						</strong> There had been issues concerning<strong>site organization
						</strong>, and stakeholders requested a more modern feel.
					</p>

					<p>How can we best promote sustainability within facilities purchasing and present the
						information in clear, concise manner?</p>

					<hr>
					<h3>Team</h3>
					<p>
						While working with Noblis, a nonprofit organization that delivers advisory solutions to the
						federal government, I acted as a contractor to GSA. Due to budget constraints, I was working as the sole designer and developer on this
						effort. While this gave me creative freedom, I was responsible for all aspects of this design
						from creating the user journey to high-fidelity wireframing to coding my own prototype. I
						solicited feedback from another designer within my greater team to vet my designs and create a
						collaborative environment.

						</div>
					</div>

					<hr>
					<h3>Discovery</h3>
					<p>The stakeholders had a clear idea of the content they wanted. Since this was a public Federal
						Government website, it needed to be comply with <strong>accessibility
							needs</strong>. I conducted research on accessibility standards to better understand
						potential users. My target audience was mostly the stakeholders in question, so interviewing
						them and understanding their needs allowed me to gain further insight on their pain points. </p>

					<p>Through several iterations and stakeholder feedback, I found:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							The new section needed to match the look and feel of other upgraded pages.
						</li>
						<li>
							With busy schedules, users wanted <strong>information at a glance</strong>.Scrolling down
							the page was the least preferable option.
						</li>
						<li>
							Users were frequently on the go, so the site must be <strong>accessible from phone, tablet
								and laptop</strong>.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h5>Challenges</h5>
					<p>Since the website was over 10 years old, it had undergone various phases of redesign by several
						different engineers and companies. This led to a lack of consistency across the website - it
						lacked a style guide, basic layouts and unified color choices. With limited resouces, I had my
						work cut out for me.</p>

					<hr>
					<h3>Wireframes & Validation</h3>
					<p>A simple wireframe had been completed during the inital stakeholder meeting using PowerPoint.
						This was done rapidly and mostly focused on the information architecture and hierarchy of pages.
						The stakeholders wanted to surface areas they had on their site that were hidden and nested
						under several layers and pages. Originally, it took over 10 clicks to navigate to these pages.
					</p>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6">
							<img class="img-fluid b-1" src="images/sftool/Apply - Wireframe.png"
								alt="Apply Low-Fidelity Wireframe" />
							<h5 class="center m-0">Apply Low-Fidelity Wireframe</h5>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6">
							<img class="img-fluid b-1" src="images/sftool/Case Study - Wireframe.png"
								alt="Case Study Low-Fidelity Wireframe" />
							<h5 class="center m-0">Case Study Low-Fidelity Wireframe</h5>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						The left navigation was a direct result of these conversations, as it fully highlights
						the three core areas of this new section of the site. The introduction of the left navigation
						cut down the number of user clicks by over 50%. Due to security and budget concerns, all
						low-fidelity wireframes were done via PowerPoint and on whiteboards.
					</p>

					<hr>
					<h3>Implementation</h3>
					<p>After gathering the information from the stakeholders and existing development team, I
						created a high-fidelity wireframe. Most of the information was extracted from the existing
						website. Content for new pages was provided by the stakeholders.</p>

					<h5>Apply Landing Page</h5>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6">
							<img class="img-fluid" src="images/sftool/Apply Before.png" alt="Before" />
							<h5 class="center m-0">Before</h5>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6">
							<img class="img-fluid" src="images/sftool/Apply After.png" alt="Karen Su" />
							<h5 class="center m-0">After</h5>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>The original landing page lacked a central focal point for the user. With the split
						screen view, the user is presented with double the information, which may be
						overwhelming. This caused the user to spend more time on the page, searching for
						information.
					</p>

					<p>The goal was to simplify the landing page, so the user can navigate to the desired
						information without having to spend extra time searching. After iterating with the
						stakeholders, these three Agency Lessons became the core of this
						page. The three panels indicates that each is a clickable item, and the icons give the users an
						idea about what each section contains.
					</p>

					<p>The lack of scrolling on this page ensures that all information is either presented
						immediately on the page, or through accessible links.
					</p>

					<h5>Case Studies Page</h5>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6">
							<img class="img-fluid" src="images/sftool/Case Study Before.png" alt="Before" />
							<h5 class="center m-0">Before</h5>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6">
							<img class="img-fluid" src="images/sftool/Case Study After.png" alt="After" />
							<h5 class="center m-0">After</h5>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p> The case studies page was originally a very long scrollable list. There was no search feature on
						this page so finding a specific case study meant scrolling and paging through several pages.
						Adding this as an item on the left navigation bar cuts down on the number of user clicks by 70%.
						Displaying the items in a grid allows the user to quickly scan all the case studies without
						needless scrolling.
					</p>

					<p>Since government computers tend to have smaller screens, the main concern here was
						finding a way to visually present the information and eliminate excess scrolling. The black
						overlay expands to the full width of the picture when hovered over, and thus retains the ability
						to display detailed text, without taking excessive vertical space.
					</p>

					<hr>
					<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
					<p>
						Throughout the process of redesigning this area of the website, it was tempting to create
						custom, modern layouts with new sleek colors. The ultimate challenge was creating a unified
						theme amongst the hodgepodge of pages.
					</p>

					<p>
						I found that reusing existing patterns and limiting colors not only reduced risk of sensory
						overload for the users, but also was easier on the developer’s end (in this case, me) to build. That
						being said, there is still a lot of improvement to be made on SFTool.
					</p>

					<p>
						SFTool still has several other pages that need to be redesigned to fit this new, modern look. If
						given the opportunity, I’d like to create a unified style-guide and design system that would inform
						design decisions to implement a unified, consistent style.
